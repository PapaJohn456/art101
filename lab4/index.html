					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Restate the challenge of the lab here.</p>
					The biggest challenge was trying to learn javascript. My initial approach was to watch a youtube video and how to make rock,paper scissors, but 
					I found most of their solutions confusing, so I did in the way that made sense to me.

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>What problems arose? How did you solve them? </p>
				   The way I had the winner function detect the winner was by checking the list that had the player input first and then the 
				   computer input. It would if the player input was rock,paper or scissors and based off that answer it would check the second item in the list,
				   computer input, to check the win conditions. One issue I had with this is that the list would exceed 2 items. The quick solution was to add an if statement
				   that would check if the list exceeded 2 items in which it would reset it. This would then add another issue where it would do that, but because
				   of the placement it  would still exceed 2, 4 being the max. The solution was to move it where it would create 4 and only have the players input in the list.
				   I also had an issue where my button wouldn't work which was because I didn't correctly name everything the same.

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? </p>
					Although I thought the lab was something else I'm still glad I made this work. I've had previous coding experience with python, godot, and assembly.
					This was a nice way to remember some stuff and honestly after learning a language or general concepts it was pretty much a question of "Well how can I do ___ in JavaScript."
