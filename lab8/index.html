			<h1>Lab 7 - Functions</h1>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Restate the challenge of the lab here.</p>
					The good about the labs are the references we have access to, so when I have an error regarding to how I'm typing the code
					I know I can look at the lab assignment and look at how the code is written there. I didn't find the lab challenging, but like 
					all the others it enforces more knowledge for when we work on the group project.
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>What problems arose? How did you solve them? </p>
					Adding () gave me an error. I would put array.map instead the name of the array then .map. I also found out that because I added ()
					for list.map(functionName); it for some reason caused the other one (the one with the function inside it) to not print. It wasn't 
					until I removed the () from the first where it would print and I thought that to be weird. The results section prints the numbers
					but not in a list like the example shown, but I think that's ok so I left it.
				
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? </p>
					It went smoothly, but I'm taking extra time work it to get an annoying bug fixed.
					I gave the extra step a shot and was simple enough to follow the instructions. Did I fully understand how it worked? No, but maybe in the 
					future I will. I'm happy that we can map arrays instead of having to for loop them.
