					<h1>Challenge</h1>
					<p>This is the most annoying lab because I didn't know what was wrong and 
						couldn't figure out what was wrong with it. It's challenging because it's easy 
						to make one mistake that will mess everything up.
					</p>
					
				</div>

				<div class="minor-section" id="problems">
					<h1>Problems</h1>
					<p>At first I followed the instructions which helped except for what I now know was the issue. The main issue I had 
						was that the divs in html need to have the class along with the id which I only had the id. I found about because of
						the discord and it just worked. I was trying to append stuff, making the class special which would make the dots
						permanently show up.
					</p>

					<h1>Results</h1>
					<p>button speaks for itself.</p>
