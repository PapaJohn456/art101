					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Restate the challenge of the lab here.</p>
					<P>The main challenge came from the random issues you come across. Sometimes you'd think doing a task would be easy, 
						but then you encounter a problem that'll mess it up. One thing I did find weird was the different ways to write notes.
					</P>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>What problems arose? How did you solve them? </p>
					<p>I had issues with the css not showing up on my website which I thought the issue was not having the link added, but 
						I just now found out it was because the website updates the html code first then the css. There were problems where 
						I thought the css code wasn't working, but it was because I didn't save the html code. Another issue that
						actually made her css code not work, so the solution to that was copy paste the html was lab3 into lab2. I have have no idea 
						what the actual problem to that was, but what matters is that it's fixed. One last problem I encountered is the little green 
						area below the paper image. I tried to make the image fill up the entire box, but couldn't. To be fair I didn't try to fix it for
						too long.

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? </p>
					<p>I really enjoyed this assignment because it's fairly simple and gives you a good foundation to start learning all the 
						weird stuff that's in html and css. I put some solid effort in this assignment and experimented with a couple "what if" scenarios.
					</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>A good introduction to coding in html/css that allowed us to mess around with some options to see what code does what and in 
						the end we got 2 websites that are different.
