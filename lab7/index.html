					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Restate the challenge of the lab here.</p>
					The lab was pretty easy and straightforward if you were in lecture this past thursday. I took the easy approach 
					and did all the tasks in one line. Also I'm sure we did this lab in class, but I didn't save me work.

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>What problems arose? How did you solve them? </p>
					One issue that really annoys me is the prompt. It pops up twice which I didn't understand why, so my initial idea was
					that the function was somehow running twice. With that in mind I simply made the userName var at the beginning and made
					it's count zero. Then in the function it'll do the prompt if it equaled to zero, so when the name is given it'll give it
					a length other than zero. This would work if ONLY the function was being called twice, but it wasn't the case and realized
					it has to be the entire code which invalidates what I did. I then thought it was being I was calling the function in the 
					writeln, so I made another variable that equalled to the function so I can put aa string variable in the writeln. I then realized
					that I think whatever is in the html is making is run twice and trying to insert a string in writeln wouldn't work. I have not
					solved this, but if they website shows only one prompt it's because I somehow fixed it.

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? </p>
					It went smoothly, but I'm taking extra time work it to get an annoying bug fixed.
