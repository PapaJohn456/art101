					<h1>Challenge</h1>
					<p>For the first time in a while I tried to do this lab without looking at the example code and simply copying what's given, so it was nice to
						do something without that. I really like that if I couldn't do it I could always look at it. That being said I didn't have a much of a challenge 
						with this lab.
					</p>

				<div class="minor-section" id="problems">
					<h1>Problems</h1>
					<p> The base assignment was done without problems, but I wanted to take into account numbers and my solution was to check if the input was an integer then
						return ":|" or something like that. I tried if (x instanceof integer), if (x%0 !=0), and x != x(int) and x !=(int)x. At this point I give up and will simply turn in 
						what I have. It's not that deep.
					</p>
