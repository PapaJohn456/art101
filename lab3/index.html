					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					This Lab did not take a long time to finish, but the challenge came from my shitty laptop. For some reason it decided
					to just die on me and not turn on despite it being charged. I eventually fixed it by figuring out that I can drain
					the battery by charging my phone and forcing it to reset that way which worked.
					<p>Restate the challenge of the lab here.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>What problems arose? How did you solve them? </p>
					Aside from my laptop failing on me I didn't really have any problems aside from trying to allign the text to the middle which I couldn't do.
					I'm sure a solution could be to refer to p and edit the size of the text to make it and h1. I feel like the solution is to change the type. I tried
					the text:align thing and the left: _px which both didn't work.
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? </p>
					It's a very simple lab that can be done quickly with the knowledge from the previous lab, but it works well for more practice.
					I didn't too much effort into it, but I plan to put in more time into the bigger projects and especially the group one.
